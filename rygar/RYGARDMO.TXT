This level is nothing fancy, just a quick demo of Rygar 
Improvement's capabilities. It took me about half an 
hour to do, a testament to the editor's ease of use. 
(Nice job, Chris!)

Please note that only the first level is playable; 
I have purposely sealed the exit.


Requirements:
-Rygar ROM USA V1.0 NOTE: ALL ROM REQUESTS WILL BE IGNORED.
-UCON or any other IPS patching utility.

How to Use:
-Make a backup of your Rygar ROM. This is very important in 
 case something goes wrong during the patching!
-Place the rygardmo.ips file in the same directory as your ROM.
-Use your IPS utility to patch the ROM with the edit patch.
 (Ex: Type "ucon i rygar.nes rygardmo.ips" at the DOS prompt.)

That's it! Now just run the patched ROM with any emulator (or 
even on your console if you're lucky enough to have a backup
unit, I assume it'll work).
