<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Where to get this document</A>
</H2>

<P>The latest version of this document is always posted at
<A HREF="http://tril.tunes.org/games/z1spec/">http://tril.tunes.org/games/z1spec/</A></P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Disclaimer</A>
</H2>

<P>The information in this document is not guaranteed to be correct.  I take
no responsibility for the integrity of your Zelda rom file if you mess it
up.  Please use patch files (such as the standard patch format being
adopted by several emulator authors) instead of modifying rom images
directly, so you don't lose the original game or ruin it for somebody
else.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Before Reading This Document</A>
</H2>

<P>Before reading this document, you are expected to know what a pattern
table is.  If you don't, read a document devoted to NES technical
information first.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.4">1.4 Numeric Conventions</A>
</H2>

<P>All numbers are in decimal, unless written with a dollar sign ($), for
convenience by those who aren't used to hex.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.5">1.5 IMPORTANT Note about Offsets</A>
</H2>

<P>Offsets are all from the start of PRG ROM, not from the start of
ZELDA.NES!  To calculate offsets into ZELDA.NES, add 16 bytes (the size
of the .NES header) to every offset in this document.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.6">1.6 About this Document</A>
</H2>

<P>I am releasing this document into the public domain.  However, if you find
it useful, or if you have any comments, don't hesitate to send me an
e-mail.</P>
<P>I created this document so that my friend Conrad could create a map
editor.  However, I also enjoy reading 6502 assembly code and solving
tough problems.  I intend to eventually account for every byte in the
Zelda ROM, but I am putting off work on that for a while now that this
spec is basically done.  It should be enough to create a decent map
editor, if it is correct.  If it is not correct, let me know and we can
try to fix it.  I hope you get as much fun out of using this document as I
had making it.  Keep hacking!</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.7">1.7 The Art of ROM Hacking</A>
</H2>

<P>When I did a (pretty intensive) search for "zelda hack" in my usual search
for duplicate projects before beginning something new, I came up with a
lot of sprite modifications (clearly made using various NES pattern
editors that are readily available), and a page with a few offsets that
were apparently guessed at random.  This is a sad and pathetic state.  
Why doesn't anyone do things the right way?  The ONLY way to get accurate
information about modifying a game is to dig in and immerse yourself in
its machine code.  I hope this document, when released, will show people
what is really possible and encourage them to repeat what I have done, for
other games.  Only afterwards can you call yourself a ROM hacker.  Using a
program someone else has written doesn't count (this goes for all the
script kiddies, too)!  However, getting the information for this document
was a lot of work.  Don't get frustrated right away, and you will find
some very interesting things in the depths of code, and perhaps even a new
perspective on programming- from the outside.</P>
