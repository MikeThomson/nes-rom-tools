<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 The Overworld Map</A>
</H2>

<P>The overworld is 16 screens wide by 8 screens high.  Screens are numbered
0..127 starting at the upper left corner, moving left to right, then top
to bottom.  Therefore the screen number is calculated by 16*R + C where R
is the map row and C is the map column.</P>
<P>However, not all 128 overworld locations are entirely different.  Some
have the same graphic as another location.  Each unique screen is stored
once.  Screens that have the same picture, but different colors, can still
share the same memory for their graphic (the colors are stored elsewhere).</P>
<P>The overworld screen table stores 124 unique screens of 16 bytes each (see
the next section for a description for individual screens).  These in no
particular order.  The overworld map contains 128 bytes, one for each 2-D
map location.  Each byte in the overworld map refers to one screen in the
overworld screen table.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Overworld Screens</A>
</H2>

<P>One screen in the overworld is 16 columns wide.  Each column is 11 squares
high.  Each screen takes 16 bytes, one byte for each column of squares on
that screen.</P>
<P>Before we learn how to find the data for a column, we need to discuss the
format of the data for a column.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Columns</A>
</H2>

<H3>Column Data Format</H3>

<P>The data for column is 11 bytes, one byte for each square in the column,
stored in order from top to bottom.  A square is made of 4 tiles arranged
in a 2x2 square on the screen.  </P>
<P>It takes 11 bytes to draw a column, but these aren't always stored as 11
consecutive bytes in memory.  Instead, if two squares (one above the
other) are the same graphic (use the same tiles), they can be stored in
one byte instead of two.  The number of bytes it takes to store a column
depends on how many squares are stored doubly.  The minimum number is 6
bytes (if there are 5 duplicated squares and one left over), and the
maximum is 11 (if no squares are duplicated).  There is no way to
duplicate more than 2 squares at a time, so even if all the squares in a
column are the same, you still need 6 bytes to store that column.</P>
<P>There are 64 possible squares (although not all of the 64 possible may be
actually used).  This means that only 6 bits are needed to store the
square number.  Since each square uses one byte, there are 2 extra bits in
the byte for each square.  The meaning of a square byte is described in
section 4, "Squares."</P>
<P>The 6 bits for the square number are stored in bits 0-5 of each byte in
the column data.  If bit 6 is set, this square is a duplicated square and
will take up two rows, one above the other, in this column.</P>

<H3>Column Tables</H3>

<P>The column data for 16 different columns is stored together in what we
will call a "column table."  A column table contains the 6-11 bytes for
each of the 16 columns in that column table, stored all in one contiguous
area of memory (which, if you do the arithmetic, could be as small as 96
bytes, or as large as 176 bytes, depending on how many total squares are
doubled in the columns inside the column table).</P>
<P>The first byte of the 6-11 bytes for an individual column always has bit 7
set.  This is how to locate columns within a column table.  We have now
accounted for all 8 bits of every byte inside the column data.</P>

<H3>The Column Directory</H3>

<P>There are 16 column tables, for a total of 256 different columns in the
overworld.  The addresses of the beginning of each column table are stored
in a table of column tables, which we will call the "column directory."  
I have copied these addresses and converted them to offsets in the ROM in
the above table in the rows "Column Table XX", for your convenience.</P>
<P>(The naming for this two-tiered table structure is taken from Intel's
description of its tiered structure for addressing memory pages in the 386
processor's virtual memory model.  This model uses a "page directory"
which contains pointers to "page tables", which in turn point at
individual pages, which are 4K blocks of memory that are the unit of
memory allocation.)</P>

<H3>Indexing a Column</H3>

<P>Now we can understand the meaning of the 16 bytes in each overworld
screen.  There are 256 columns, so each column byte in an overworld screen
refers to one column.  The high nibble of the byte selects which column
table to use from the column directory.  The low nibble selects a column
from that column table.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 Squares</A>
</H2>

<H3>The Primary Square Table</H3>

<P>The primary square table is an array of 64 (or 56?) bytes, one for each
square number used in the column data.  The values in the primary square
table are used to determine the tiles to draw for a particular square
number.  If the value is greater than or equal to 16 (hex $10), then it
refers to the first of four consecutive tiles in NES Pattern Table 1
(Pattern Table 0 is not used for map background tiles).  The 4 chosen
tiles are the upper left, lower left, upper right, and lower right tiles
for that square, in that order.  If the value in the primary square table
is less than 16, the four tiles in this square are taken from the
secondary square table (using the value that is less than 16 as the
index).</P>

<H3>The Secondary Square Table</H3>

<P>The secondary square table contains tile numbers for squares in the
overworld that have one or more tiles repeated.  To save space in the
pattern tables, pattern tables only store tiles for squares for which all
the tiles are unique.</P>
<P>Each entry in the secondary square table is 4 bytes long, and there are 16
entries (indexed by values in the primary square table that are less than
16).  The bytes specify the tile numbers (again in Pattern Table 1) for a
square in the same order used by the primary square table.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.6">2.6 Secrets</A>
</H2>

<P>Secret squares are marked by a special value in the primary square table.
When the map is drawn, the primary square table value for a secret is
translated into the value for the graphic that should be shown where the
secret is.  This includes checking whether you have gotten the secret on
that screen, if applicable.  There are 6 possible secrets: a pushable rock
($E5), a tree in the forest with a door under it ($E6), a round bush with
stairs under it ($E7), a well ($E8), a statue ($E9), and a statue with
stairs under it ($EA).</P>
<P>There can be only one secret per screen.  If you were to put more than one
secret on a screen, only the last one (the bottommost square of the
rightmost column that contains a secret) would be marked as the row and
column that a secret is at (and therefore would be the only secret you
could use by walking into it), and all the secrets on the screen would
share the same state of whether they were found or not, since there is
only one bit per overworld screen devoted to storing that state.</P>
