;Put the emulator's full filename with path on the first line.
;On the second line, put the path of the rom you want to test. MegaFLE hasn't the ability to find out,
;it shouldn't be neccesary though, but do it if things doesn't work.
;Note that the path and filenames has do be in dos 8 character lenght, like in the first line.
;The emulator must also support rom loading using the commando line. You know, i thought you were to
;stupid to understand that :P
;Also, if you wan't to add more arguments to the
;commando line, do it on the third line.
;I'll add support for setting this in MegaFLE, later.
;You'll have to update this file very rarely anyway.
