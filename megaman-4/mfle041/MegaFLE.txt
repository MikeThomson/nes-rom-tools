| What is MegaFLE? |
+------------------+

MegaFLE is a level editor for Megaman 3, 4, and 5.
It was easy to create a level editor with these three,
becouse they have nearly the same level format.

MegaFLE is coded in QuickBasic, so it's a byte Slow.
(I'll give it a new name: SlowBasic)
I might make a windows version sometime,
whenever i learn some form of Win programming.

+------+
| Why? |
+------+

MegaFLE?
Just like MegaEdit, Mega means MegaMan.
FLE means Full-Level-Edit, this program let's you
edit everything about an level, even CHR.

I love the Megaman games, they are one of my most favourite NES Games.
And since there were some MegaMan games yet to be made a level editor for,
i wanted to create it, becouse i had the formats.
And besides, i can't wait to use MegaFLE on my own hacks :)

This is a Beta version. There are more things that
i'd like to add in so its to be updated.

Please, if you find any bug, i will be thanksfull of a report.
There are things that are low-prioritied, like MM4 support,
so if you really want a feature to come fast, just contact.
Also, feedback boost my interest on creating this thing.
All comments and bug reports are welcome at: Ingegjoestoel@hotmail.com

A guide is now being written in html, in a zip included.
Note that it's not complete yet.

+-----------------------------------+
| The Megaman 3 - 5 Level Structure |
+-----------------------------------+

This section is outdated, but should still be just as useful.
I will move it to the guide later.

Palettes
--------
Each level has it's own bg Palette and Palette Effects.
Palette Functions makes one of the four palettes to rotare
to make a effect. Palettes can be switched during the level.

Pattern Table (aka CHR aka Vrom)
--------------------------------
Each level has it's CHR. But this is not a part
of the level itself. It's either in CHR-ROM or somewhere else in the
PRG-ROM. CHR can be switched during the level.

Screen
------
Okay. Let's start. The level is built of screens. On each Screen Position, 1 of 32
Screen Presets can be used.  In the level data, there is data on wich screen to use for
each screen position. This utilizes that a Screen Preset can be re-used, in a totally
different part of the level and with totally different sprites. This is called Screen Order.

Well, the data in a Screen Preset has wich Structures to use in the Screen preset.
These are 4x4 tiles in size, wich means there are 8x8 of them in a Screen Preset.
The structure can be 1 of 256. (Wich again means a Screen Preset is 64 bytes in size)
Blah blah blah. I think you got it.

Again, each structure has it's data. This is wich 4 TSA Blocks to use in the Structure.
TSA Blocks are 2x2 tiles in size. The blocks can be 1 of 256.

Then finnaly, we have come to the inner of this system. There are two different kinds of
TSA Block data. The first, are wich type this block are (BG, Wall, FG, Spikes, .. and many more), and which palette
the block uses (0-3). Those two data's are 4-bit, so they are
kept in one byte. (Each block has 1 byte with both Palette and Type data).
The other kind of TSA Block data is wich 4 tiles from the Pattern Table the block is made up of.

Enemies (aka Sprites)
---------------------
Each sprite has 4 bytes of data. The first is wich Screen Position to make the
sprite appear in, the two next is the X and Y positions of the sprite, and the last is
the Sprite Type. Note that sprites must come in correct screen order (Sprite 1 can't be
on Screen Position 0 if Sprite 0 is on Screen Position 1, etc.) The different games has
different methods to decide wich CHR banks and Palettes to use when different sprites is
showed. Megaman 3 for example, has this data in the Map Data. Megaman 4 has only wich
Bg Palette to use in the map data, Megaman 5 has wich sprite palette to use in the Map
Data, but the CHR's is loaded automatically depending on wich
Sprite Types that is showed up. Cool!

Scroll Data
-----------
This decides how the direction scrool goes. Each position has one byte, where the 4 first
bits tells how many screens the direction type is used on, and the next 4 bits tells
the direction type. There are also other bytes for each position; wich bg CHR, bg Palette,
sprite CHR banks and sprite Palette to use, but how many of these
that is used, is game-dependent.

+-------------------------------------------+
|Tile and Palette loading method's and pages|
+-------------------------------------------+

This is also to be re-written in the guide.

As you know, the level uses CHR and Palettes. Different games
has different methods loading CHR and Palettes. It also switches them in the middle of
the level. MegaFLE should be able to locate the correct CHR and Palettes using the
level's settings, if not, use the alternative CHR or Palette setting by checking the boxes
so an "x" will appear, then set the "CHR page" or "PAL page" number until the graphics
seems nice. Alternative setting is usually only required at multi-levels,
Title Screens, Boss Screens etc.

MegaMan 3
---------
MM3 has 2 pointers for each level that points to which
BackGround CHR to load for the whole level. This is the Point0 and Point1
numbers. In MM3, BG-CHR is by default not switched, but some few sprites does effect
on it. The BG Palette is switched by scroll data (BG Pal). The Sprite CHR and Palette is also swithced by scroll data
(SPR Chr/Pal), wich does effect on both those. In Sprite Editing mode, you will be able to edit the SPR-CHR sets,
which is wich two CHR banks to use for each "SPR Chr/Pal" value.

MegaMan 4
---------
Megaman 4 has a very horrible way to load these things on, and i haven't figured it all
yet. But each level has a start data, wich includes wich BG-CHR, SPR-CHR and SPR-PAL to load at the beginning of the level.
MegaMan 4 has some scroll data i call "effect data". This may do alot of strange things that effect
CHR and Palette and other things. The BG Palette is choosen by the scroll data "BG Pal".
There are also some sprites around that also changes the BG palette. For now, you can edit
these two scroll datas, and you can select the CHR set with CHR page.
Support for editing the start level setup and "effects" should be added
later on.

MegaMan 5
---------
Here, sprites reign. Well, just like in MM3, it is two pointers telling which CHR to START
loading for the level. (Point0 and Point1). But there are those mighty sprites that does
those CHR animations and CHR switches in different sets of the levels. Sprites is also the elements that switches
parts of the BG Palette, but i think some other data i haven't found yet switches the whole BG palette to a different
PAL set. The Sprite CHR is loaded automatically depending on wich sprite types that is used where you see them.
The Sprite palettes is selected by the scroll data "SPR Pal".

+----------------------+
| What Will Be Aviable |
+----------------------+

 * Full Support For All Levels In Every Game
 * Level Insert/Extract to various Formats
 * Sprite Editing? (Enemy Stats, Graphics etc.)
 * Data Edit Mode (Sounds, Speeds etc.)
 * Sprite CHR Editing?

This is the plan for the features in the final version.
MegaFLE was first meant as a level-only editor, but i've chosen
to update it with editing of other data. There'll probably be
some betas before version 1.0. The next version comes when i feel
it's time for a new version, so that is totally unknown for now.

The newest relase will be aviable at Dragon Eye Studios: http://www.cg-games.net/dragoneye/
