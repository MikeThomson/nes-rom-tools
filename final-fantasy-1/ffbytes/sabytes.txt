Address of Data ; 30400-304CC

Enemy special attack data consists of a simple and familiar 5 bytes

What I mean by familiar is they work almost exactly like Magic Data.

I- This byte acts very much like that of User magic, 
 Damage has 20, Special Effects has 18, 05, and 00.
   
II- Effectivity Byte ;
 again, this is a Scale of 00-255 for various Effects, where as some effects,
 changing this byte will change what happens. 

III- Element byte ;
 this byte denotes the Element of the magic (of course)
  01 = GAZE, FLASH, SNORTING, INK, DAZZLE, seems to be special effect element again
  02 = GLANCE, POISON(dmg), POISON(pos), STINGER, got me...
  04 = GLARE, Dunno
  08 = Instant Death
  10 = Fire
  20 = Ice
  40 = Lightning
  80 = Earth

IV- Targetting
 Simple notation of Targetting
  01 = One Party member
  02 = Whole Party

V- Effect
 Very much like the Magic Effects.
  01 = Damage
  03 = Negative Effect
   03 + 01 Effectivity = Death
   03 + 02 Effectivity = Turn To Stone
   03 + 04 Effectivity = Poison
   03 + 08 Effectivity = Darkness
   03 + 10 effectivity = Stun
