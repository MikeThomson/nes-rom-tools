<P>The QAKE, boss, the QAKE!</P>
<P>Welcome to Fantasy Island!... er, the Final Fantasy Spell Editor!</p>
<P>I know what you're thinking... this is supposed to be a help document, not a repository of bad jokes!  After all, <b>someone</b> needs to warn you that you use this program at your own risk, because it hasn't been extensively tested, and in oddball circumstances, conceivably might contribute to corruption of any or all of the following:</p>
<OL>
<LI>Your hard drive (since Windows is silly)</LI>
<LI>Your Windows installation (see above)</LI>
<LI>Your Final Fantasy ROM Image (see below)</LI>
<LI>Your Final Fantasy saved game (Best to just keep all bases covered here)</LI>
<LI>Your mind (since use of the program could constitute cheating)</LI>
</OL>
<p>Thus, <B>someone</B> needs to warn you to <B>always</b> make a backup of your ROM image before using this program on it, since this program will modify that image, unless you click read-only in the File|Open dialog.</p>
<p>And, <B>someone</b> needs to let you know that if anything does get corrupted, you're on your own... you have nobody to sue, as this program is released without any warranty or guarantee of fitness of purpose, by the terms of the <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org">GNU</A> <A HREF="COPYING.TXT">Library General Public License, Version 2.0</A>.   Note that the author does not agree with the Free Software Foundation ideologically, it's just easier to release this cheap little program under the LGPL, than to write a new license, or to go download the MPL or something.</p>
<p>Yes, since the Final Fantasy spell editor is LGPL'd... you get to see the source code, and may NOT distribute the program, nor any changes you make, without also distributing the source code yourself!</p>
<p>Oh, and <b>someone</b> needs to remind you that asking people you don't know for ROM images is considered VERY bad form, be they Final Fantasy, American Gladiators, Family Home Fitness, or whatever.  And, depending on what your friend(s) are like, they may not even be good people to ask.  The author of this program promises that any threatening, harassing, obnoxious, or just plain evil emails he receives will be put to good use:  the sender's address will be sold to spammers.  So don't ask!<p>
<p>Finally, <b>someone</b> should let you know that future versions may or may not be coming out, with new features... so check back where you downloaded this, same BRAK time, same BRAK channel!</p>
<p>Oh, and <a href="MGBYTES.html">here</a> is an HTML conversion of the document used to write this program... contains all the information about how the magic spells are stored in the ROM, and what all those numbers mean. <a href="MGBYTES.TXT">Here</a> is the text document itself, in case I messed something up in the  HTML conversion.  Note that there may or may not be errors in the documentation, but the program should be correct.</p>
