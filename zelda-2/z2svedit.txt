Z2PLEDIT [filename]

If you do not specify a filename, the program will ask for one.
The default filename is "Zelda2Ed.NES"

All the included files need to be in the same folder as the program and rom.

Remember to make backup copies of your original file, you WILL need them.

============
How to use:
============
"Press A to jump. Press B to crack the whip.  TIP:  Press A and
 B at the same time to jump and whip at the same time."
     -Manual, Castlevania

The program starts in the map selection mode.

=================================
Keys while in Map Selection Mode:
=================================

* Use Page Up and Page Down to select the map.
* Use 'E' to edit the level.
* Use 'M' to edit the monsters.
* Use 'W' to toggle between 'weak enemy' and 'strong enemy'.
* Use 'P' to configure options
* Use 'O' to edit the overworld (or just run overedit.exe)
* Use 'ESC' to quit.
* Use 'N' to run Nesticle.
* Use arrow keys to scroll the level.

=================================
Keys while in Level editing mode:
=================================

* Arrow keys select an object and scroll.
* The numeric keypad moves the object.
  (press num lock a few times if it doesn't work.)
* '+' and '-' change the object value.
* '*' and '/' change the object type.
* '[' and ']' move all objects after of the selected
  object backwards and forwards.
* 'T' enters the 'Tileset Editor'.
  From there you can change the 'basic blocks' and
  tileset of the map.
* 'F' enters the 'Flags Editor'.
  From there you can change the length of the level,
  the object set, and wheather there are bushes or grasses.
* 'P' enters the 'Palette Editor'.
  Use this to change the colors of the level.
* 'B' enters the 'Background editor'.
  Change the background from clouds or trees, or
  even edit the clouds or trees!
* '<' and '>' (shift optional) scrolls the map without
  changing the active object.
* 'S' saves the level, so the changes actually happen.
* 'I' checks the level for problems that would render the level unsavable.
* 'ESC' gets out of the editor and returns to the map selection mode.

=================================
Keys while in Enemy editing mode:
=================================

* Arrow keys select an object and scroll.
* The numeric keypad moves the object.
  (press num lock a few times if it doesn't work.)
* '+' and '-' change the kind of enemy.
* '*' and '/' increase/decrease the enemy by 4.
* '<' and '>' (shift optional) scrolls the map without
  changing the active object.
* 'S' saves the level.
* 'ESC' gets out of the editor and returns to the map selection mode.

   FAQ:
==========
"The CHEETAHMEN ran off...
 ...And now... The CHEETAHMEN!"
    -Story Text, Cheetahmen

Q. How do I change text?
A: Get Hexpose.  It's a special hex editor.
   You'll also need the correct .TBL file.

Level issues:
=============
"When I have no more lives
 left, that's the end of me!"
  -Link in manual, Zelda 2

* The volcano background doesn't work in Western hyrule, due to the
  presence of Princess Zelda's graphics.  Likewise, Princess Zelda
  doesn't correctly appear in East Hyrule.
* When breakable blocks are placed outside palaces, they appear invisible,
  but act normally.  Use this for invisible bridges/walls and stuff.
* The Crash objects 10-1F appear as fences in East Hyurle, but crash in
  west hyrule.
* The graphics for West Hyrule are displayed in East Hyrule, cactuses
  and forests have slightly different graphics after travling on a raft.
* The palettes for the palaces don't match the ones in the actual game,
  (but match the FDS version...)

============
Game Issues:
============
"I AM ERROR"
    -Error, Zelda 2

* When you have a "once only" item (collectable bouns, locked door, boss...)
  that only appears once, there can only be 1 per "page" (16 squares).  This
  means you can have a candle and boss in the same room, but not the same
  page.


===============
Program Issues:
===============
"As you guide Link through the levels of hyrule, close-ups and
 overviews will enchance your video vision."
    -Back of box, Zelda 2

This program uses DIRECTQB, so it will sometimes randomly crash on startup.
You need at least 512k EMS memory to run this program.

You can't add objects...yet.
You can't remove objects...yet.
