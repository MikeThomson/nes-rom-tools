======================================

Version History:
1.0 First release

------------------------------

This program edits the N-Spade Card Base Deck, this is the deck the game uses to create the 8 other decks you
see in the game. You can re-arrange the cards or replace them, make them all stars or leave out just 1-ups, whatever
you desire.

This editor also edits what item the power-up cards (mushroom, star, flower) give you.

Main Editor:
====================================

Use the mouse and left click one of the bottom row cards at the bottom of the window. The card
you clicked will show up on the right as the selected card. When you click one of the cards
in the upper left hand corner, it will be replaced with the card in the selected card area.

Power-Up Card Editor:
===================================
Explains itself, just use the list boxes to select which item you will receive with a match with each card. They will NOT
replace the gfx, you must do this on your own.
