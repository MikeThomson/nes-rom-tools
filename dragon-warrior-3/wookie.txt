Version 1.0

This program lets you edit which monsters are in the fighting
rings in castles.  You can edit the monsters, and the odds.

TO USE:
  
  Run the program, then type in the filename of the ROM or click
  the open button for the Open dialog box.  You should back up
  your old rom if you want to use this program.
  
  When a valid file is in the text box, the program activates.
  Use the << and >> buttons to select a battle.
  
  To change an enemy, click on the button with the enemy's name on
  it.  You can also add enemies where blank ones are.  To set the
  odds, type in the new odds in the text box next to the monster's
  name.  You can specify values from 0 to 255, but the recommended
  range is 1 to 430, as 0 and the biggest numbers are unpredictable.
  
  After making any changes click the Save button to write the
  changes to the ROM, or click Undo to restore the settings to
  normal.  If you move on to a new battle without saving first,
  your changes are lost, so SAVE FIRST.
  
NOTES:
  
  The game will sometimes lose enemies if they can't fit on the
  screen, or there is not enough VRAM available for the enemies'
  graphics to load.  You can't have a battle consisting of 4 different
  large enemies, the game will just not load some enemies.
  
  Baramos, Baramos Bomus, and Zoma fill the whole screen, so don't use
  them.
  
  When a monster casts Healus, it heals a random enemy!  When a monster
  casts Increase, is increases every monsters defense!
  
  Metal slimes and metal babbles have extremely low defense.
  
OTHER STUFF:
  
  If you click on Show Offset, it will show the ROM offset where the
  data is loaded from.
  
  If you click on the ... next to the Open button, it will show a table
  containing all the enemies and their hex values.
  
  The toppings contain potassium benzoate.
