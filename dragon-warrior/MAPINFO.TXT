Dragon warrior 1 level format:

All the town data is stored in this format:

Each half-byte (nibble) is one tile.
For example:  FF FF FF
              F6 FF 6F

That would be the throne in the throne room.

In the game it would look like this:
þþþþþþ (FFFFFF
þ°þþ°þ  F6FF6F)


Listing:

Number|  Tile
------+-------------------
0     | Grass
1     | Desert
2     | Water
3     | Treasure Chest
4     | Solid Stone
5     | Stairs up
6     | Red brick floor
7     | Stairs down
8     | Forest
9     | Poisonous Swamp
A     | Barrier
B     | Locked Door
C     | Weapon shop symbol
D     | Inn Sign
E     | Bridge
F     | Desk


All town maps come in the following sizes:
30x30
24x24
20x20
10x10


Shrine data:

Shrine data is stored the same way as town data with one exception,
tiles only go 0-7, the last bit determines wether there is a roof
in previous maps.


Dungeon data:

Same as above but with different tiles:

Number| Tile
------+------------------
0     | Stone wall
1     | Stairs up
2     | Red floor
3     | Stairs down
4     | Treasure Chest
5     | Locked door
6     | Princess Gwaelin
7     | Black wall

The last bit is also used for roofs.


Overworld format: (RLE)

The first half byte determines which terrain is drawn, the second how many.
Example:
02 12 02
01 14 01
00 16 00
13 20 13
00 16 00
01 14 01
02 12 02

This produces this:

°°°²²²°°°
°°²²²²²°°
°²²²²²²²°
²²²²^²²²²
°²²²²²²²°
°°²²²²²°°
°°°²²²°°°
