WHAT IT IS
-------------------
This is a pretty limited program. All it does is extract the compressed word 
table from Radia into a Thingy-format TBL file. It outputs in romaji instead 
of real kana, because my computer doesn't have Japanese capability (yet). 
Worse, some of the words aren't extracted correctly, because they contain 
other compressed words. Hey, feel free to improve it, though.


WHAT YOU'LL NEED
-------------------
A Radia ROM (named radia.nes, in the same directory)


WHAT TO DO
-------------------
Run the program. It outputs to radiacom.tbl.


TERMS OF USE
-------------------
This program is distributed with its source code. You may use,
distribute, and modify it freely. Only two restrictions: These terms of use 
must stay the same, and you must always include the source code with the
program. Oh, and I'd appreciate it if you credit me as the original
author.


DISCLAIMER
-------------------
All games and systems mentioned are copyright their respective companies. 
I am not responsible for any damage you may cause to your computer or 
software by using this program. Owning a ROM is illegal unless you already 
own the cartridge. If there are runners on first and second and fewer than 
two outs, a fly ball hit to an infielder shall be ruled "caught" even if 
the infielder drops it. I think that about covers everything.
