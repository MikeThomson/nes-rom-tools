Note this is a beta. Color is not yet supported, and the no-carrot signs are glitchy; better support for them in the next version.



Open your rom.

Use the horizontal sliderbar to select a level, and hit 'load'.

Use that mass amount of tiles in the corner to select which tile to paint with.

Right-Click on the bottom half of a sprite to pick it up, and left-click anywhere in the editor 'canvas' to place it.

Or, use the vertical sliderbar to select a sprite. Click on the sprite in the little box next to it to pick it up and click in the canvas to place it. For the Misc. objects, another vertical bar appears. Use that to change the misc object.

Hit save to save your level to the rom.


Tips:
Place a sprite at 0x0 to disable it for the level.

Bugs Bunny CAN NOT start with an x position of 0.
