* "|N|||A|["- Clears the title screen.
* "|o|C|i|||o|Ã?"- This is used for the saving process or saving the bytes in a text file. At the bottom of the window that pops up, press the top button to apply the results for the saving process, or the bottom button to save the data in a file.
* "ROM|C|Ã?|||Ã?"- Click on this to choose a different ROM.
