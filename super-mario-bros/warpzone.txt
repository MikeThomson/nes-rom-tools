To create a Warp Zone, you must place a #69 block in special row 2.
You should place the block in a cleared out area since the palettes will 
shift to include blue & white.

Also, for the Warp Zone to function, you will need pipes.
You must use a pipedown2 pipe for the pipes to function.  
Pipes go 12, 16, and 20 blocks before the #69 block.

Placement of the warp in world 1 will give you warps 2-4.
Placement of the warp in worlds 2-4 will give you warp 5.
Placement of the warp in worlds 5-8 & non-pipe special levels will give you 
warps 6-8.

It is not recommended to place warps in worlds 6-8 because the warps are the
same as the levels they are in.  They may not work correctly, and usually 
the "Welcome to Warp Zone!" and numbers are in the wrong place.
