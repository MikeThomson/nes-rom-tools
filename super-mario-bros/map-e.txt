@ Configuration
    It can be set up with 16 check boxes of the bottom right. 
    Establishment can't keep it automatically. 
    But, when "map.ini" is edited, it can be set up easily. 

    1. The indication of the map 
    2. The indication of the enemies
    3. The indication of back ground
    4. The indication of XE object

    5. Always on top 
    6. Error skip (debug)
    7. Palette reading 
    8. Keyboard operation 

    9. The indication of the target 1
   10. The indication of the target 2
   11. The indication of the tree (buggy) 
   12. The indication of the target 3

   13. The indication of the glid 
   14. It isn't used. 
   15. error window
   16. small window


   * To the person using the CPU which is too fast...
    Increase the value of "wait" in "map.ini" if a CPU is too fast. 
    You can use value 00-99 for "wait". 


@ Pipe Code
  You will be found the pipe object is 2byte. 
  When the 2byte is written "XX YZ" ,
  "XX" is the MAP code of the destination. 
  "Y" is ("WORLD which the pipe code is effective in" -1)*2. 
      ex. WORLD1:0 , WORLD2:2 , WORLD3:4 , WORLD8:E
  "Z" is PAGE of the destination. 

      * The pipe object is ignored if the value of "Y" isn't correct. 


@ Limitation and Specification 
  * you cannot have more than 3 objects/column. If it doesn't do so, 
    The "object of the page after it" stops being indicated. 
  * The interval of the object can't be left over one page. 
    It is good when the object (0F) which can't be seen is put. 

    *** It hasn't translated yet. ***



Report it if there is a bug. It is modified if it is possible.
