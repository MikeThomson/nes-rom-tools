Schnapsidee - beta 0.1
======================
by Matrixz (Dragon Eye Studios)

What is Schnapsidee?
--------------------
A editor for 1942 for NES. It originally started as a
editor for a ASM-hack of 1942, but that project didnt become
anything, so i wanted to do something with what i had so far.

Current Feature List
--------------------
 * Level Palette Editing
 * Screen Order Editing
 * Screen Editing
 * Block Attribute Editing
 * Block TSA Editing

Future Plans for Features
-------------------------
 * Enemy Editing
 * Titlescreen Editor
 * CHR Editing
 * Enemy Score Editing
 * Sprite Assembly Editing
   (how sprites are built up, not program code)
And misc. other data in 1942.

Im planning to release a pair of updates, or more.

Keys
----
F5 - Save
F6 - Previous Level
F7 - Next Level
F8 - Reload Level
F9 - Quick-test (see qtest.txt)
F10 - Configuration Menu

In the next release i will probably write clearer instructions on how the editor
and the configuration menu works. You currently have to find out most things by yourself,
but it shouldnt be too hard.
