Ultima II The Quest of the Avatar Map Editor v1.0

[General]
The main Interface has two frames, one hold the tileset and the other
one holds the map buffer.

[Tileset Frame]

 [Tile #]
 It will display the hex value of the selected tile
 
 [Tile]
 the square under that label will show a 64x64 zoom of the 
 selected tile

 [Point]
 This is the actual (X, Y) location of your mouse pointer inside the 
 map buffer.

 [Sextant]
 The game has an item named sextant, it shows your (Y, X) position in
 the map. So for the sake of orientation I added it.
 
 [Tileset Block]
 To select a Tile just click on it or right click any tile on the map

[Map Frame]

 [Map Buffer]
 The game divides its overworld map into 8 32x256 blocks. Due to the
 speed limitations I had when coding this program(VB) I cut out the 
 buffer into the same 8 blocks, it takes about 70 seconds to load
 an entire block. Sorry about this one, I might improve this in
 further editors.

 [Block]
 Just select the block you want to load, be careful because the program
 won´t ask you if you are sure blablabla, however your changes are
 always active(not saved but still there)

 [Current Block]
 Well.....
 
 [Grid Color]
 Click on the box to select the grid´s color. If the GRID checkbox
 isn´t checked, it wonpt draw the lines.

 [Grid checkbox]
 If you select it AND reload your block, it will display grid lines.
 The grid is on by default.

[Program Menus]

 [Load ROM]
 It WON´T check if you´re loading a valid ultima 2 nes rom. Most map
 editors have it and I hate that :) How ever, if you load an invalid
 file, you might get errors and maybe your file will be wiped out!

 [Save Changes]
 It saves the MAP stuff ONLY! It doesn´t save items and other things.
 They have their own save button.
 
 [Quit]
 Just that, plain and simple.

 [Game]
  
  [Characters]
  Have you ever used a save state editor???? Well, it´s quite the same.
  These are the stats and starting things of your characters.

  [Items & Balloon]
  You can change the location of certain items, including the starting
  position of the balloon.

  [Prices of Items]
  It let you edit the price of almost every item in the game no manroot
  or fungus).
  
  [Location of towns]
  Read the READ THIS button for more info.

 [Help]
 You´re reasing this right??

 [About]
