To Use the FTE:
	1) Load the file.
	2) Read the intro.
	3) Load a File ([left ALT]-[F])
	4) Edit Data

What you need (besides this program):
	1) A usuable ROM (.nes format)
	2) An emulator
	
* Some Notes *
	+ Originally, FTeditor was going to be just for my use.  However, I
	  have decided to give it to certain Web Pages.  So this means that I
	  really am not trying to make a program that really looks nice, but
	  something that will allow me to get what I want done.
	
	+ Anyone that has ever programmed in QuickBASIC (or QBASIC) will 
	  notice that the interface is very similiar to QuickBASIC.  That is
	  probably because it is supposed to!  I programmed FTeditor entirely
	  with QuickBASIC, and have started with scratch.  That is why there
	  is so many little bugs or glitches with it, especially with the 
	  File/Open Window Box.  Currently QuickBASIC is the best I have to 
  	  make FTeditor with.  This is another reason why I am not spending
	  much time on beautifying this program.
	
	+ The File/Open Window Box is limited to the first 100 .NES files 
	  in a single directory.  If this isn't working out for you, let me
	  know.

* Important *
	+ YOU MUST USE FTEDITOR ON YOUR HARD DRIVE, WHICH MUST BE C:
	
        + If the ROM you have does not work with FTeditor, use FTfixer.  Just
	  type the name of the file after FTfixer.exe.  If you are using 
	  windows, just drag the ROM file over FTfixer via 'File Manager' or 
	  'Windows Explorer.'  It will now work with FTeditor; note that this
	  will allow ANY file to work...so do not do it with anything other 
	  than Tecmo Bowl I.  I am not responsible if this ruins your ROM, so
	  you may want to make a back up copy.
	  Example:  FTfixer.exe TECMO.NES
