Table Dumper Pro

Copyright © 2011 by Dave V. Di Giorgio

Version 11.11.28

Special thanks to harmony7 for helping me with the comdlg32 issues and
finding me a freeware icon editor (IcoFX) that actually works!

Thanks also to RadicalR for some initial beta testing.

______________________________________________________________________________
IMPORTANT REQUIREMENT FOR USE:

Table Dumper Pro requires 'comdlg32.ocx', which is freely distributable by
Microsoft.  Many people already have this file registered on their
computer.  If you don't already have it, I have included it with this
package.  You have 2 options:

1) Put 'comdlg32.ocx' it in the same directory as the .exe.
2) Put it in your System folder and register it by dragging it to regsvr32.

Table Dumper Pro was programmed entirely in VB6 (SP5).  So, to get it to run
in Windows 7 simply select the properties of the .exe, go to the Compatibility
tab and click "Run this program in compatibility mode for:" and choose
"Window XP (Service Pack 3)".

accompanying software you indicate your acceptance of the following
Table Dumper Pro Freeware License Agreement ("Agreement").

1. LICENSE.  Dave V. Di Giorgio ("DvD Translations") hereby grants you
   (each licensee is addressed as "you") a non-exclusive, transferable
   license to use its software product and accompanying external documentation
   (the program's object code, its INTERNAL documentation, and this ReadMe
   are collectively referred to as the "Software".  The external
   documentation, the Op Codes and .tbl files are collectively referred
   to as "ASSOCIATED FILES") on the following terms and only for
   non-commercial purposes (see Section 2 below). You may:

   a. use the Software and Associated Files on any computer in your
      possession;

   b. make copies of the Software and Associated Files; and

   c. distribute the Software (subject to the requirements of Section
      3 below) only in the form originally furnished by DvD Translations
      with no modifications whatsoever.  If you have the slightest doubt
      that your copy of the Software is not original, you must contact
      DvD Translations for an original copy.

   d. You must distribute all the original Associated Files in their current
      form, but you may, and are actually encouraged to, create and include
      additional valid Op Codes files for different 6502/7 computers or
      consoles, for different mapper chips, and, if possible, different
      processors.  You must give credit to the person who created the file
      in the first line of the file, and include the date that it was created
      and/or last modified.  You must contact DvD Translations and give them
      a copy of the newly created files so that we might include them in
      a new official release.

2. LIMITATIONS ON LICENSE. The license granted in Section 1 is subject
   to the following restrictions:

   a. The Software is to be used only for non-commercial purposes
      unless you obtain DvD Translations' prior written consent.  Prohibited
      commercial purposes include, but are not limited to:

          limitation, providing support or maintenance for the Software;

     (iii) Using the Software to develop a similar application on any
           platform for commercial distribution; or

      promptly notify DvD Translations upon learning of any violation of the
      above commercial restrictions.

   c. On each copy of the Software you must conspicuously and
      appropriately reproduce DvD Translations' copyright notices (see Software

      and give any other recipients of the Software a copy of this
      Agreement.

   d. You may not modify, combine other commercial applications with,
      or otherwise prepare derivative works of the Software.

   e. DvD Translations, in its sole and absolute discretion, may have included
      a portion of the source code or online documentation of the Software.
      Except for any such portions, you shall not REVERSE ENGINEER, DECOMPILE,
      DISASSEMBLE, OR OTHERWISE REDUCE ANY PORTION OF THE SOFTWARE TO ANY

3. DISTRIBUTION: As used in this Agreement, the term "distribute" (and
   its variants) includes making the Software available (either
   intentionally or unintentionally) to third parties for copying or
   use, including providing timeshare access. Each time you distribute

   restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
   herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance with this
   Agreement by recipients.

   CREATION, PRODUCTION, OR DELIVERY OF THE SOFTWARE BE LIABLE TO YOU
   OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY GENERAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL,

   damage award, suit, judgment, or other legal action (including
   reasonable attorney's fees) arising out of your use, distribution,
   modification, or duplication of the Software.

9. TERMINATION. The license granted hereunder is effective until
   terminated by DvD Translations.  You may terminate it at any time by
   destroying the Software and all Associated Files. This license will
   terminate automatically if you fail to comply with the limitations
   described above. On termination, you must destroy all copies of the
   Software and all Associated Files.  The termination of your
   license will not result in the termination of the licenses of any

   so long as they are in compliance with the provisions of this
   Agreement.

10. EXPORT CONTROLS. None of the Software or underlying information or
    technology may be downloaded or otherwise exported or re-exported

    concerning this license between the parties and supersedes all
    prior agreements and representations between them. It may not be
    amended. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be

    Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
    Goods is expressly excluded. Address all correspondence regarding
