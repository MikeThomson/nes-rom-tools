1.  Introduction 
______________________________________________________________________________________

UniTSA is a universal TSA editor for NES ROMs. It uses configurable INI files for each
game. It also provides a lot of options, so if your ROM uses a form of standard TSA
it should be supported by this utility. UniTSA supports sprite TSA, although this may 
not work for some ROMs.

This utility came about from a conversation in #romhacking on EMUnet one night. 
Gil-Galad suggested such a utility, but initially I wondered whether or not anyone 
would use such a utility. Then Thaddeus popped up with a 
"you should pursue such an editor" and UniTSA was born! The next day was spent solely
working on UniTSA, and by 11:30 21/04/2003 the first version was complete! (I did 
sleep for 10 hours in between, and watched a lot of TV too) Anyways, that was how 
UniTSA came about :). Told in the style of an excitable person!

3.  Using UniTSA
______________________________________________________________________________________

See the document that I have included with UniTSA on how to create a data file for
UniTSA. 

UniTSA works like most TSA editors. You have the pattern table on the right and the
tile on the left. You click on it a bit. It's pretty simple stuff. I think it is well.

4.  FAQ
______________________________________________________________________________________

Q.  What is TSA?

A.  See the document that I have included with UniTSA. It wasn't written by me, but I
    believe it perfectly explains TSA, and what you can do with it. Thanks to Setzer
    for writing this document and for allowing me to include it btw ;)

Q.  This program is glitchy as hell! Why?

A.  Erm, it's not glitchy. If your data file is crappy, then the program will interpret
    it crappily. Future versions may have a lot more protection against crappy 
    datafiles, but I believe it may sacrifice power. So the moral of the story is,
    make good datafiles!

Q.  Creating the datafiles using Notepad is too much work! Make an editor for them!

A.  This may come in the future. For now, get used to Notepad.
