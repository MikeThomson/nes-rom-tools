This program is intended for corrupting ROMs, but can be used on other files too.

It does not affect the original ROM, it creates a backup and corrupts the copy.  Use this for fun/funky effects or finding level data.

To use it, just specify the ROM/EMU path, the rom filename, and the EMU filename (ie. 
"Nesticle.exe") and the range of data to corrupt, and even the corruption method!  It will safely corrupt the copy of the original.

Yeah, it's changed since the last release and I'm too lazy to revise that stuff above.

It's not version 6 because the replace with a sequence isn't in yet.
