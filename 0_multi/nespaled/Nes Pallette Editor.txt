The Nes Pallette reader will help you finding your palletes a little
faster than raw hex search. It´s like using a normal hexeditor but you
see colors instead of numbers.

[File / Open]
Loads a file into the editor

[File / Save]
Saves the active file

[File / Quit]
Guess...

[Edit / Goto F5]
Type an address and the editor will take you there, addresses must be
in hex, strings with prefix are accepted too (&H or 0x)

[Find / F3]
Type the fours colors of the pallette your looking for (use Nesten or
Nesticle to figure out the values)

Double clikc an item and the "Pallette Editor" will pop up, click on
a colored box to change the double clicked item. You can change "X"
bytes too.
