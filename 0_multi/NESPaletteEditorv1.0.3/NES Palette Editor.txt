NES Palette Editor
Programmed by: The_Fake_God (The_Fake_God@hotmail.com)
Additional Updates by: MegaManJuno

* THIS PROGRAM IS OPEN SOURCE*

The NES Palette Editor will help you finding your palettes a little
faster than raw hex search. It´s like using a normal hexeditor but you
see colors instead of numbers.

[File / Open]
Loads an NES ROM into the editor.

[File / Save]
Saves the active file.

[File / Quit]
Close the application.

[Edit / Find (F3)]
Type the fours colors of the palette your looking for (use another
resource to figure out the values)

[Edit / Goto (F5)]
Type an address and the editor will take you there, addresses must be
in hex, strings with prefix are accepted too (&H or 0x)

[Options / Disable editing of "X" bytes (F7)]
Enabling this option prevents double-clicks for editing bytes marked as
an "X".  Disabling it restores editing capabilities on these bytes.
(Default value: Enabled)

[Options / Hide unlikely values (F8)]
Enabling this option hides values that fall within the NES color range
but do not occur in a sequence of at least 4 consecutive colors.
Disabling it shows all values that fall within the NES color range.
(Default value: Enabled)

Double-click an item and the "Palette Editor" will pop up, click on
a colored box to change it.

 VERSION UPDATE HISTORY
========================

-------
 1.0.3
-------

* Corrected instances of the word pallette (a piece of armor) to
  palette (as in reference to a color palette).
  - [MegaManJuno]

* Capitalized occurrences of "NES" since it's an acronym and is the
  preferred presentation.
  - [MegaManJuno]

* Added an Options menu with 2 entries to toggle the following:

    > When "Hide unlikely values" is enabled, the main window now only
      displays colored bytes where a sequence of at least 4 are found in
      succession. Otherwise, they display as black with the "X" label.
      (Default value: Enabled)

    > When "Disable editing of "X" bytes" is enabled, the double-click
      on bytes marked "X" is prevented so that the Palette Editor window
      will not load on these bytes.
      (Default value: Enabled)
  - [MegaManJuno]

* Fixed the scrollbar not resetting to the initial position when loading
  new files after the first (the offset display would revert to the 
  0x00000000 position, but the scrollbar would remain at the old location).
  - [MegaManJuno]

* Source formatting for easier readability.
  - [MegaManJuno]

-------
 1.0.1
-------

* Fixed the Palette Editor window to show the missing row of colors
  (10-1F).  You can now select from all 64 colors in the palette and not
  just 48 of them.
