Hey, welcome to TGLedit-Labyrinth Master

What this program does is ramdomly re-creates the labyrinth of Naju. 
Never play the same TGL game twice!

What do you need?

Simply put your Guardian Legend game in the same directory of the Labyrinth
Master Program. Also make sure the "tgltext" file is located in the same 
directory as well. When entering the name of your Guardian Legend ROM,
DO NOT add the ".nes" extension. 


any questions? comments? or dollars?

contact me!

take care 

I love God
