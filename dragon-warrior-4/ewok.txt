Version 2.0

This program lets you edit which monsters are in the fighting
ring at the casino in Endor.  You can edit the monsters,
and the odds.

TO USE:
  
  Run the program, then type in the filename of the ROM or click
  the open button for the Open dialog box.  You should back up
  your old rom if you want to use this program.
  
  When a valid file is in the text box, then the program activates.
  Use the << and >> buttons to select a battle, and click "Chapter 2"
  or "Chapter 5" to use a different set of battles.
  
  To change an enemy, click on the button with the enemy's name on
  it.  You can also add enemies where blank ones are.  To set the
  odds, type in the new odds in the text box next to the monster's
  name.  You can specify values from 0 to 255, but the recommended
  range is 1 to 230, as 0 and the biggest numbers often overflow.
  
  After making any changes click the Save button to write the
  changes to the ROM, or click Undo to restore the settings to
  normal.  If you move on to a new battle without saving first,
  your changes are lost, so SAVE FIRST.
  
NOTES:
  
  The game will sometimes lose enemies if they can't fit on the
  screen, or there is not enough VRAM available for the enemies'
  graphics to load.  You can't have a battle consisting of 4 different
  large enemies, the game will just not load some enemies.
  
  There are dummied (removed/rare) enemies available on the list,
  but the Troubadour (Palette Swapped Roric) sucks as he only has 1 HP
  and no MP.  He can't attack either.
  
  Esturk and Necrosaro fill the whole screen, so don't use them.
  
  If Necrosaro kills an enemy, he will lose a limb/evolve an extra one
  and the killed enemy automatically revives.
  
  If Linguar is in the first slot, it causes a messed up battle
  where the Linguar splits, and then only the real Linguar will fight.
  The real Linguar can't attack itself, so it hits a mirage.  The match
  will inevitably end in a draw due to overtime.
  If Linguar is not the first enemy, it will just fight, and its
  tongue is perminantly sticking out.
  
  The traveling merchant speaks in third person, says he's dazed, and
  has 1 HP.
  
  The Slime (King Slime version) has around 35 HP, but has almost no
  attack power.
  
OTHER STUFF:
  
  If you click on Show Offset, it will show the ROM offset where the
  data is loaded from.
  
  If you click on the ... next to the Open button, it will show a table
  containing all the enemies and their hex values.
  
  The frogurt is also cursed.
